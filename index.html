        <div id="display_text">
            To My Dearest Friend Lyradale Padernal,</div>
        <div id="display_text2">
            Daughter of Uncle Michael Linson Padernal and Auntie Rachel Ching Padernal, Sister of Che.
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text3">
            I do hope that life is treating her well. <br>
        </div>
        <div id="display_text4">
            It has been months since we have last crossed paths.
        </div>
        <div id="display_text5">
            Oh how lonely this world is without Lyradale Padernal. 
            <img src="home.png"/><br>
        </div>
        <div id="display_text6">
            The weekly zoom meetings are not enough to find her in this big big world. 
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text7">
            The only way I can find her is if I ZOOM out. Wayyyyy out. <br>

        </div>
        <div  id="display_text8">
            But alas, we shall meet again after the quarantine. (or perhaps in heaven (hopefully))<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text9">
            Life won't be the same after this, but I know Lyradale Padernal will still be the same.<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text10">
            She can be tough sometimes because of her reserved nature, but that just adds to her charm. <br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text11">
            My quiet demeanor sometimes leaves me unnoticed by others, but Lyradale Padernal notices me. <br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text12">
            Some may say there's 7 wonders of the world, but there's actually an 8th. Lyradale Padernal.
        </div>
        <div id="display_text13">
            When God said "Let there be light" he created the sun and Lyradale Padernal.
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text14">
            Lyradale Padernal can talk to anyone. When she was a child she asked a stranger about his private parts.<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text15">
            If someone is looking for a perfect wife I will tell them Lyradale Padernal.<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text16">
            Kindness, caringness, lovingness, cleanliness, genourosness are just some words to describe Lyradale Padernal.<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text17">
            That is the end of my letter, hopefully not the end of my friendship with Lyradale Padernal. <br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text18">
            I hope this letter will bring a smile to Lyradale Padernal<br>
        </div>
